# Regionizer
Regionizer is a C# Visual Studio Package that serves as a document formatter, code generation utility and auto commenting system. For development you will need Visual Studio 2017 or 2019, and make sure Visual Studio Extensibility SDK is installed in Visual Studio.

For now the repo clones duplicate copies of UltimateHelperEx, DataJuggler.WPF.Controls and Xml Mirror.RunTime.Ex

I will eventually turn these into NuGet packages, but I have been behind on updating NuGet for the 
strongly typed copies of the project.

After the Shared Repo is fully dissambled I will tackle this.
